//Input parameter file for pdb.exe program
//1st parameter contains input file name
//2nd parameter contains input file type: 0 - PDB input file, 1 - Vesta XYZ input file, 2 - Kirkland XYZ file, 3 - text file with orientations/defocuses.
//3rd parameter contains optional carbon support layer thickness and transversal extent (x=y) in Angstroms, separated by a single white space
//4th parameter contains the desired CT sample cube side length in Angstroms (should be large enough to contain the whole sample inside for arbitrary 3D rotations)
//5th parameter contains the desired rotation angle around z axis in degrees
//6th parameter contains the desired rotation angle around y' axis in degrees (y' is the y axis after the initial rotation around the z axis)
//7th parameter contains the desired rotation angle around z" axis in degrees (z" is the z axis after the initial rotations around the z and y' axes)
//8th parameter: 1 = shift the structure so that to centre it in the determined minimal containing ball, 0 = do not shift the structure
//9th parameter: maximum distance (in Angstroms) between two atoms to be considered "duplicates" and remove all but one; if this distance is negative, no action will be taken
//10th parameter: sort output: 0=no_sort, 1=sort_by_z_coordinates_ascending 2=sort_by_occupancy_column_values_descending (sorting according to atomic numbers is always done)
//11th parameter contains output file name
//12th parameter: 0 - muSTEM-format XTL file, 1 - Vesta XYZ file, 2 -  Kirkland-format XYZ file
//13th parameter contains the free-form info line that will be recorded into the first line of the output file

// This program reads a PDB, Vesta XYZ or Kirkland XYZ file, 
// centers the position of the "molecule" within the "enclosing cube" [0, ctblength] x [0, ctblength] x [0, ctblength],
// optionally adds a layer of amorphous carbon immediately upstream of the "molecule" along the z coordinate,
// optionally rotates the "molecule" (together with the carbon substrate) by the given "intrinsic" Euler angles around the z, y' and z" axes, and
// optionally removes "duplicate" atoms that are located closer than the given distance to other atoms in the "molecule",
// optionally sorts all atoms in ascending order with respect to z coordinate or with respect to decreasing occupancy parameter, and
// outputs the data in the form of a muSTEM, Vesta XYZ or Kirkland XYZ file.
