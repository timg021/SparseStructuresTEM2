//Input parameter file for pdb.exe program
//1st line contains input test file name
//2nd line: type of the 1st input file: 0 - PDB input file, 1 - Vesta XYZ input file, 2 - Kirkland XYZ file.
//3rd line contains Euler rotation angles in degrees that are applied to the test structure before comparison
//4th line contains input reference file name - must be equal to or longer than the test file
//5th line: type of the 2nd input file: 0 - PDB input file, 1 - Vesta XYZ input file, 2 - Kirkland XYZ file.
//6th line contains the maximum distance in Angstroms below which a found atom match is considered acceptable
//7th line: output file sorting: 0 - no sort, 1 - sort by ascending order of z coordinate, 2- sort by distances between the matched test and reference atoms in the ascending order
//8th line contains output file name
//9th line contains the free-form info line that will be recorded into the first line of the output file
