Brief description of the "inverse" simulation (3D object reconstruction) module "PhaseRetrieval.exe"
of the Differential Holographic Tomography (DHT) software package

PhaseRetrieval.exe module performs 3D object reconstruction and reprojection tasks, 
using input data (defocused images) that have been generated by the MsctKirkland.exe module. 
This program has been written in C++ and can in principle be compiled under any OS supporting 
standard C++ compilers and execution environment. However, at present the executable 
module is only available for 64-bit Windows OS. Any Windows x64 PC can in principle be 
used for running this code, but multi-core CPU systems are recommended for faster 
execution.

This program is based on the DHT algorithm described in [T.E. Gureyev, H.M. Quiney, A. 
Kozlov, D.M. Paganin, G. Schmalz and L.J. Allen, Relative roles of multiple scattering and 
Fresnel diffraction in the imaging of small molecules using electrons, Part II: Differential 
Holographic Tomography, arXiv 2012.07012].

The Euler angle convention corresponds to that in Heymann et al, Journal of Structural Biology 151 (2005) 196–207.

The two main "modes" of execution of PhaseRetrieval.exe correspond to:  
(1) reconstruction of a 3D distribution of the electrostatic potential from defocused 
images (or complex amplitudes) generated by MsctKirkland.exe program for a set of 
different orientations of the imaged object and different defocus distances;
(2) reprojection through a 3D distribution of the electrostatic potential that was either 
generated by MsctKirkland.exe from an XYZ file or, more commonly, was previously reconstructed
by the PhaseRetrieval.exe program itself from defocused images. The result of the reprojection
operation consists of a set of defocused complex amplitudes calculated at the rotational orientations
and defocus distances specified in the text file from Parameter 1 for the input data.
As follows from this description, "mode 2" is not mutually exclusive with "mode 1", and the two
modes can be performed sequentially in a single execution of PhaseRetrieval.exe.

Also, the result of the "reprojection" operation ("mode 2") (a set of defocused complex amplitudes)
can in turn be used as new input for PhaseRetrieval.exe, giving the user an option for manual iteration
of the DHT reconstruction. The latter option can in priniciple be used for iterative refinement of
the DHT reconstruction, however this option has not been fully tested yet at this time.

The control of execution of PhaseRetrieval.exe program is managed via an editable text file 
PhaseRetrieval.txt which contains all modifiable input parameters for PhaseRetrieval.exe. In 
order for the program to run, the input parameter file PhaseRetrieval.txt must be present in 
the same folder where PhaseRetrieval.exe is started from. Alternatively, the name of a suitable input
parameter file can be presented as the first command-line argument (following the PhaseRetrieval.exe
name in the command line) when starting PhaseRetrieval.exe program. In this case, the parameter
file can be given an arbitrary name and can be located in any place accessible from the started
instance of PhaseRetrieval.exe. The format of these input parameter files is fixed and must
comply exactly with the structure described below.

The format of PhaseRetrieval.txt file allows any number of "comment" lines to be present
at the beginning and/or at the end of the file, each such line starting with two forward
slash symbols, "//". The comment lines are ignored by by PhaseRetrieval.exe. Other 
(non-comment) lines must all have the same structure and the fixed sequential order with 
respect to each other. Each non-comment line consists of:
(a) an arbitrary "expression" with no white spaces, which typically represents the name of a 
parameter. The contents of this parameter name expression are ignored by 
PhaseRetrieval.exe. An example of the parameter name 
is "9.Output_defocus_distances_min_max_and_step_in_angstroms:".
(b) one or more alphanumerical entries separated by a single white space from each other 
and from the parameter name, each such entry representing one parameter value, for example 
" -30.0 0.0 0.1171875", which corresponds to three parameter values equal to -30.0, 0.0 and 
0.1171875.
Note that the number of white spaces separating the parameters must be equal to one, 
otherwise a "zero" parameter may be wrongly read in. There should be also no further white 
spaces after the last parameter in the line. Each line should be terminated by the usual "end-
of-line / new line / caret-return", etc., symbols, as common for a given OS. The number and 
types of parameters in each parameter line of the file PhaseRetrieval.txt is pre-determined and 
cannot be changed, only the values of these parameters can be edited. The parameter names 
and comment lines are supposed to give explicit hints as to what type and how many 
parameters are expected in each line. 

Here is a typical example of a valid PhaseRetrieval.txt parameter file.

Note that the "numbering" of parameters in the parameter names, such as "14" in 
"14.Output_defocus_distances_min_max_and_step_in_angstroms:" is inconsequential and is 
ignored by PhaseRetrieval.exe. On the other hand, the order of the parameter lines in this file 
is very important and must be the same as in the above example. In other words, 
PhaseRetrieval.exe interprets the input parameters according to the order of the non-comment 
lines in the parameter file, while ignoring any numbering that may or may not appear in the 
parameter names.

In the above example, Parameter 1 determines the amount of diagnostic information that PhaseRetrieval.exe 
outputs during the execution. 

Parameter 2 contains the name of an input file with rotation angles and 
defocus distances, which is usually the same file that was previously used by 
MsctKirkland.exe program to generate the set of input defocused images. This file may have one
of two distinct formats which is determined by the file name extenstion. 
(a) If the file name extension is ".txt", the file may contain an
arbitrary number of leading comment lines, each starting with a pair of forward slashes "//". 
Non-comment lines all have the same structure, but may contain different number of entries, 
according to the following scheme. Columns one and two always contain the rotation angles (in degrees)
around the Z and Y' axes, respectively (where Y' axis is the Y axis after the initial rotation
of the 3D space around the Z axis). These two angles are followed by an arbitrary number of pairs
of values, with each odd column (starting from the third one) containing the angle (in degrees)
of rotation around the Z'' axis (Z" axis is the Z axis after the initial rotations
of the 3D space around the Z and Y' axes, which corresponds to the optic axis = illumination direction). 
Each even column (starting from the fourth one) contains a defocus distance in 
angstroms along the Z'' axis. The number of lines in this file is not limited.
An example of a valid "rotation angles and defocus distances" file is given below. 
(b) If the file extension is ".RELION", then this file contains an arbitrary number of lines,
each line containing exactly nine entries, separated by white spaces, with the following contents:
1st entry contains the sequential number of the line - this parameter is not used in MsctKirkland.exe
2nd entry contains the name of the file where the data was sourced from - this parameter is not used in MsctKirkland.exe
3rd entry is the defocus distance dx corresponding to the x coordinate
4th entry is the defocus distance dy corresponding to the y coordinate
5th entry is the image shift along x in angstroms 
6th entry is the image shift along y in angstroms 
7th entry is the rotation angle "rot" around the Z coordinate in radians
8th entry is the rotation angle "tilt" around the Y' coordinate in radians
9th entry is the rotation angle "psi" around the Z" coordinate in radians
A suitable example is given below.
The text file given in Parameter 1 must be present in the same folder where PhaseRetrieval.exe is started from,
or, alternatively, the filename can include a fully specified pathname (OS specific). 

Parameter 3 contains a fully specified pathname template for the input files containing either 
defocused images (in GRD format, uncompressed 32-bit floating-point TIFF format or a
floating-point RAW file format with an optional header) or defocused
complex amplitudes (in GRC format). Note that this template is used for generation of the eventual
input and output filenames which PhaseRetrieval.exe creates by inserting a single number or a pair of
numbers that correspond to the index of a defocus distance (first inserted number) and the index of a 
rotational orientation (second inserted number). As a result, when a filename template 
"ag.grd" is given in this parameter, the output filenames may look like "ag0_00.grd, 
ag0_01.grd, ..., ag0_35.grd, ag1_00.grd, ..., ag1_35.grd, ag2_00.grd, ..., ag2_35.grd" (36 x 3 
= 108 files in total), if 36 different rotational positions, with 3 defocus distances at each 
rotational position, are specified in the file whose name is given in Parameter 1. When a filename 
template "ag1.grd" is given in this parameter, the output filenames may look like "ag1.grd, ag2, ...,
ag108.grd" (108 x 1 = 108 files in total), if 108 different rotational positions, with 1 defocus distances
at each rotational position, are specified in the file whose name is given in Parameter 1. In particular,
in the first case the number of digits in each of the two indexes is always the same, which is 
achieved by padding with leading zeros as necessary, while in the second case the zero padding is
not used (as a consequence of the given file name template, and consequently the number of digits 
in the two indexes may vary depending on the magnitude of a particular index. If index padding was desired
in the second case, the file name template could be changed to "ag001.grd". The first version of the
template interpretation (with zero padding) is also used by default, e.g. when no digits are present 
in the template file name just before the file extension (as in ag1a.grd). 
See the description of GRD and GRC file formats and an example DefocusRand36_NEW.txt file below. 
Note that when input defocused complex amplitudes are specified, there can be only one GRC file 
per illumination direction, and the subsequent 2D phase retrieval (see below) is skipped. The reason for
such a behaviour of the program is that each complex amplitude is assumed to contain the correct complex
wavefunction at the given orientaion and the defocused distance. In principle, this complex amplitude 
can be propagated to any other defocused distance by calculating Fresnel diffraction integrals. In particular,
no phase retrieval is required in this case. Obviously, such GRC (complex amplitude) input is intended
for testing and debugging purposes only, since only defocused intensities are expected to be available
under experimentally-relevant conditions.

Parameter 4 contains the parameters required for correct interpretation of the data provided in RAW input
data files. These parameters include the width(X) and the height(Y) of the image (in pixels), the length of the
optional file header (in bytes), the endianness of the file (0 = little endian, 1 = big endian), the size
of each file element, i.e. each pixel value (in bytes). The last parameter can only be equal to the length of
single-precision or double-precision floating-point numbers on a given machine. The endianness of the data file
must coincide with the endianness of the current computer / OS. This will be checked, but no endianness 
conversion will be performed. The file header is read, but not used in this program.

Parameter 5 contains the physical dimensions (in angstroms) of the images specified in Parameter 2 in
the case when these images are given in TIFF or RAW files. This parameter is ignored when the input images
are given in GRD or GRC format, since these files contain the physical dimensions of the images internally.

Parameter 6 contains the input data normalization factors f1 and f2. The data read from the input data files
is rescaled according to: input -> (input / f1) + f2. If you don't want the data to be rescaled, then the 
two numbers specified in Parameter 5 should be 1 and 0, in this order.

Parameter 7 contains the wavelength of the illuminating wave in angstroms. 

Parameter 8 contains the objective aperture in milliradians. Zero or negative value here is 
interpreted as an infinite aperture.

Parameter 9 contains the values of the spherical aberrations Cs3 and Cs5 (in millimetres) of 
the imaging system. Zero values correspond to the absence of aberrations.

Parameter 10 can be equal to 1, 2, 3 or 4. It determines the 2D phase retrieval method to be used as 
part of the DHT algorithm internally in the PhaseRetrieval.exe program. The first two methods
can be used only in the case when there 2 or more defocused images per each illumination directon,
while the second two methods can be used only when there is 1 defocused image at each illumination 
direction. "1" corresponds to the IWFR phase retrieval method [L. J. Allen, W. McBride, N. L. O'Leary
and  M. P. Oxley, Ultramicroscopy 100 (2004) 91-104.]. "2" corresponds to the CTF-L2 phase retrieval 
method [D. Paganin, A. Barty, P. J. Mcmahon and K. A. Nugent, Quantitative phase-amplitude 
microscopy. III. The effects of noise, J. Micros. (2004) 51-61.] "3" corresponds to the phase retrieval
from a single intensity according to phase = -0.5 * log(Intensity). "4" corresponds to the phase
retrieval from a single intensity distribution according to phase = -0.5 * sqrt(Kmax^2 - K^2), where
K is the contrast function, K = 1 - Intensity, and Kmax is the maximum value of the contrast function
for this defocused image. When input defocused complex amplitudes are specified in Parameter 2, the 
2D phase retrieval step is skipped.

Parameter 11 specifies if the phase-retrieved defocused complex amplitudes are to be saved in 
GRC files. If this parameter is equal to 1, then the phase-retrieved defocused complex amplitudes
are saved to GRC files, with the names that are created by modifying the input defocused intensity
filenames by changing the file extensions to ".grc" and adding the capital letter "D" before that
file extension.

Parameter 12 specifies the maximal allowed number of iterations to be used in the IWFR 
algorithm. This parameter is ignored in the cases when there IWFR method is not used.

Parameter 13 specifies, depending on the value of Parameter 10, either the minimal phase 
reconstruction error (typical value ~ 1.e-8) which leads to the interruption of the IWFR iterations
(note that in the "verbose" mode - see below - PhaseRetrieval.exe outputs the value of the phase 
reconstruction error at each IWFR iteration, so these values can be used as a guide for setting a 
sensible value of the minimal error in this parameter), or the Tikhonov regularization 
parameter (typical value ~ 1.e-12) for the CTF-L2 algorithm (setting this parameter to zero forces the 
internal implementation of the CTF-L2 algorithm to use an estimated "optimal" value of this 
parameter which can be different at each illumination direction). When the input 
dataset contains only one defocused intensity image for a given illumination direction (orientation), 
the value of this parameter is ignored.

Parameter 14 contains three related input parameters: the minimum, maximum and the step (z-
distance between successive planes) in angstroms of the output (xy) planes at which the 3D 
potential is reconstructed. The (xy) extent and the grid steps in this volume are taken from the 
input defocused images or from parameter 5 (see the information above). Note that this program requires the 
x, y and z grid steps to be the same, i.e. it always uses cubic voxels in the reconstructed 
volume. If this is not the case, an exception will be thrown and the program will be stopped.

Parameter 15 contains the "extra defocus" distance in angstroms used in the DHT algorithm 
for 3D reconstruction. Typical values of this parameter can be between 1 and 10 angstroms. 
See details in [T.E. Gureyev et al., arXiv 2012.07012].

Parameter 16 can be equal to 0, 1 or 2. It determines if and how the inverse 3D Laplacian 
filter is applied to the 3D potential. "0" corresponds to not applying the inverse 3D Laplacian. 
"1" corresponds to applying it. "2" corresponds to skipping the initial 3D potential 
reconstruction from defocused images, reading the 3D potential distribution from the files 
defined in Parameter 23 below and applying the inverse 3D Laplacian filter to the 3D potential 
imported from the files. A typical usage cycle of PhaseRetrieval.exe may consist of an initial 
reconstruction of the 3D potential from defocused images and saving them into files in the 
first run of PhaseRetrieval.exe, with Parameter 16 set to 0 and Parameters 18 set to "0 0 -1.e+6". 
This may be followed by a second run (restart) of PhaseRetrieval.exe program, with a suitably 
modified parameter file, where Parameter 16 is set to 2 and Parameters 18 are set to some suitable
values for background removal. The filtered 3D potential is saved in the 
GRD or TIFF files in the folder specified by Parameter 24, and with the names that are obtained
from the names defined by Parameter 23 by inserting letter "R" at the end of the filename, 
immediately preceding the file extension. 

Parameter 17 contains the regularization parameter for the inverse 3D Laplacian filter. If the 
filter is not used, this parameter is ignored.

Parameter 18 contains the low-pass filter width, the background subtraction value in volts and 
the lower threshold value in volts to be applied to the reconstructed 3D potential. The low-pass filter
width corresponds to the width of a 3D Gaussian with which the reconstructed 3D potential distribution
is convolved, followed by the subtraction of this low-pass filtered version of the potential from the 
original distribution of the potential. As a result, a high-pass filtering of the original 3D distribution
of the reconstructed potential is achieved, which allows one to effectively subtract away any 
slowly-varying background which may typically present due to multiple scattering or due to the insufficient
number of different orientations in the input set of defocused images. Note that the zero(0) value of
the low-pass filtering width is interpreted as "no filtering", and in this case the high-pass filtering
is not performed. A similar effect can be achieved by setting the low-pass filter width to a value that is
larger than the x-width of the reconstructed potential distribution. Following the low-pass filtering,
the background subtraction value is subtracted from the 3D potential, and any values that become lower
than the specified lower threshold value after this are replaced by this lower threshold value. 
The optimal values of the low-pass filter width, the background subtraction value and the 
lower threshold value can be determined by the user e.g. on the basis of comparison of the output 
3D potential with a priori known realistic physical values for the atomic potentials. Another method for 
fine-tuning of this scaling factor can be based on the comparison of the contrast in the re-projected 
defocused images with the contrast in the input defocused images. Note that the contrast values for the
input and re-projected defocused images are printed out by PhaseRetrieval.exe before the end of the execution,
so these can be checked by the user.

Parameter 19 can be equal to 0, 1 or 2. When this parameter is set to 0, the multislice 
reprojection of the reconstructed 3D potential is not applied. When this parameter is set to 1, 
the multislice reprojection of the reconstructed 3D potential is applied. When this parameter 
is set to 2, the initial reconstruction of the 3D potential is skipped, the distribution of the 
potential is read from the files defined by Parameter 23 and the multislice reprojection is 
applied to the imported potential. This is preceded by the renormalization of the imported potential 
according to Parameter 16, with the rescaled potential saved in the GRD or TIFF files with
the names that are obtained from the names defined by Parameter 23 by inserting letter "R"
at the end of the filename, immediately preceding the file extension. When Parameter 19 is equal
to 1 or 2, the defocused complex amplitudes are calculated at the angular positions defined 
in the file specified in Parameter 2. These defocused complex amplitudes are saved in the 
GRC files with the names that correspond to those in Parameter 2, but with the file extension
always replaced by ".grc" and the letter "R" inserted at the end of the filename, immediately
preceding the file extension. These file are saved in the folder specified in Parameter 24.

Parameter 20 defines the slice thickness in angstroms for the multislice algorithm used for the 
reprojection of the reconstructed or imported 3D potential. If the reprojection is not performed,
this parameter is ignored.

Parameter 21 can be equal to 0, 1 or 2. When this parameter is set to 0, the peak localization in
the reconstructed 3D potential is not performed. When this parameter is set to 1, 
the peak localization in the reconstructed 3D potential is performed. When this parameter 
is set to 2, the initial reconstruction of the 3D potential is skipped, the distribution of the 
potential is read from the files defined by Parameter 23 and the peak localization is 
performed in the imported 3D potential. This is preceded by the renormalization of the imported potential 
according to Parameter 16, with the renormalized potential saved in the GRD or TIFF files in the
folder specified by Parameter 24, and with the names that are obtained from the names defined
by Parameter 23, but with inserted letter "R" at the end of the filename, 
immediately preceding the file extension. The "peak-localized" 3D potential is also saved in the
GRD or TIFF files in the folder specified by Parameter 24, and with the names that are obtained from 
the names defined by Parameter 23, but with inserted letter "A" at the end of the filename, 
immediately preceding the file extension. The positions of the located peaks, as well as their intensities,
will be also saved in a Kirkland-type XYZ molecular file, provided that the number of peaks is less
than a pre-defined maximum (currently this is set to 500,000; this is done in order to avoid extremely
large XYZ files to be saved on a hard disk, which may take a very long time and occupy a lot of disk space).
The name of this XYZ file is created from the name template defined by Parameter 23, but with inserted letter "A"
at the end of the filename, immediately preceding the file extension, which in turn is changed
to ".xyz" here. This file is also saved in the folder specified in Parameter 24.

Parameter 22 defines the length (in angstroms) of the side of a moving cubic area ("box") that is
used for peak localization in the reconstructed or imported 3D potential. If the peak localization
is not performed, this parameter is ignored.

Parameter 23 contains a fully specified pathname for the output or input files (in GRD 
format  or uncompressed 32-bit floating-point TIFF format) containing 2D sections of 
the 3D electrostatic potential where the potential is either 
reconstructed by this program or was produced previously and saved in these files (the 
behaviour depends on the values of Parameters 17, 19 and 21). Note that here the pathname 
contains a "template" for the eventual output filenames which PhaseRetrieval.exe creates by 
inserting numbers that correspond to the z-index of a (xy) plane with a 2D section of the 3D 
potential. As a result, when a filename template "out.grd" is given in this parameter, the 
actual filenames with the 3D potential may look like "out000.grd, out001.grd,..., out255.grd", 
if 256 (xy) planes are specified as a consequence of the values in Parameter 14.

Parameter 24 contains a fully specified pathname for the output of various auxiliary files. 
The specified folder must already exist in an accessible location.

Parameter 25 contains the desired number of worker threads to launch during the execution of 
PhaseRetrieval.exe. The recommend number is equal to the hyper-threading capacity of one's 
computer (often, this number is equal to the number of available CPU cores times 2), minus 1 
(one thread may be reserved for the "main user thread" that leaves the computer responsive to 
user interactions during prolonged calculations). For example, if you run PhaseRetrieval.exe 
on a PC with an Intel Core i5 CPU with 6 cores, the recommended value of this parameter is 11.
